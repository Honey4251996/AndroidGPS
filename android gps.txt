The mobile application has 3 screens, one is for the main menu, one is for the map and one for listing exercises
When you open it you'll see the button which is called "gyms near me" when you click it it leads you to google maps basically
The thing is that I want it to show the exact location and it can't do it right now because it doesn't have the gps sensor
If you make the sensor work with the map it will be greatAnd also about the unit test i have no idea how to do it so just please choose part of the code and test it
And also please put comments everywhere because he wants them
